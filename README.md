# RVNE 

This program was created using a Rails back-end and the PostGres Database Gem. The link to the backend file can be accessed here :
https://github.com/RKRedfern/RVNE_backend

This program can be started by cloning both repositories, using bundle install, running <rails s> in the back-end console
and running open <index.html> in the front end console. 


RVNE was intended to be an interactive keyboard application providing users with the ability to create translations with a library of symbols and a way 
to save them with a username association. 

RVNE ended up being a great example of what happens when a young woman bites off way more than she can chew, and is humbled by the difficulty of learning 
a new coding language in a few short weeks. RVNE is not remotely impressive, but I am still proud of all I learned in creating it. 

Thanks!
